🌿 Laya Ramesh
Human‑Centered Technologist • ML Researcher (Privacy & Fairness) • Public Artist • Founder, CodeWise

Hi! I’m Laya — a technologist who blends machine learning, ethics, and artistic storytelling to build systems that are not only technically strong but socially responsible. My work spans research, education, and community impact, with a focus on making AI more transparent, equitable, and accessible.

I care deeply about the intersection of technology, culture, and people — whether that’s designing fair ML systems, teaching students through CodeWise, or creating public art that communicates complex ideas with clarity and emotion.

🎨 Art, Calligraphy & Cultural Storytelling

Beyond engineering, my calligraphy work is featured in public permanent installations in Seattle, WA and Lincoln, NE.
My calligraphy and zentangle hobby explores identity, tradition, and community.
This artistic lens shapes my approach to technology — I build systems that are not only functional, but expressive, intuitive, and human.

🎼 Music & Performance

As an All-State choir vocalist and Indian Carnatic singer, I bring discipline, emotional intelligence, and creative structure into my work.
Music informs how I think about rhythm, clarity, and harmony in system design.
