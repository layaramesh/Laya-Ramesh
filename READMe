🌿 Laya Ramesh
Human‑Centered Technologist • ML Researcher (Privacy & Fairness) • Public Artist • Founder, CodeWise

Hi! I’m Laya — a technologist who blends machine learning, ethics, and artistic storytelling to build systems that are not only technically strong but socially responsible. My work spans research, education, and community impact, with a focus on making AI more transparent, equitable, and accessible.

I care deeply about the intersection of technology, culture, and people — whether that’s designing fair ML systems, teaching students through CodeWise, or creating public art that communicates complex ideas with clarity and emotion.

🌱 CodeWise — Founder & Lead
I founded CodeWise, a nonprofit initiative that teaches students foundational CS concepts through hands-on, ethical, and culturally grounded learning.
- Designed curriculum and teaching materials
- Built ML demos and interactive tools
- Led workshops and mentored students
- Integrated fairness and privacy principles into beginner-friendly lessons
- Hired and tutored high schoolers as instructors

🎨 Art, Calligraphy & Cultural Storytelling
Beyond engineering, I create public art and calligraphy that explores identity, tradition, and community.

This artistic lens shapes my approach to technology — I build systems that are not only functional, but expressive, intuitive, and human.

🎼 Music & Performance
As an All-State musician and solo performer, I bring discipline, emotional intelligence, and creative structure into my technical work. Music informs how I think about rhythm, clarity, and harmony in system design.
